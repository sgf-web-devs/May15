## 6 Questionssssss

1. **SUMMON** Is the CSS even being summoned by the page?
2. **STALE** Is the CSS stale because of file caching?
3. **SELECTOR** Does the selector match the element?
4. **SPECIFICITY** Is a more specific selector overriding the property?
5. **SUPPORT** Is the property supported by the browser (version/doc mode)?
6. **SATISFY** Does the property satisfy the need independently?
